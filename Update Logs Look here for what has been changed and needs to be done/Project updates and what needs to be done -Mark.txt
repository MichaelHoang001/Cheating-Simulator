+ changed the controls for cheating and switching the questions,
  now its mapped to dpad, left and right dpad is for switching questions 
  and holding up dpad is for cheating, makes it easier to play since you
  are only using your thumbs and its closer together so no likely to mess up hopefull.

+ Added a if clause so you can only answer again once you release the one of the buttons,
  this might just be a problem with the controller I have (the A button is a bit wonky).

+ changed the time interval for the other players test to switch every 3 seconds instead of 5.
  Is it too fast?

+ Added a mini-tutorial to tell player the controls

+ tutorial ends leads straight into the game, appears only in the editor the lights are dim, you can fix this in the editor
  but when you actually build an .exe file and play it nothing is wrong.

- Can add a ready button before starting straight into the real game.

+fixed test texture problem, also changed the texture to a exam sheet texture

+Made it so you cannot see the answers on anyones tests without holding the cheating button.

+The answers on the other students test will only show the answers for the questions you need.

+Fixed the problem with player character model standing up.

-Need to fix controlls so you dont answer two questions on accident.

-Change the amount of time the answers on other students test change?

-need to add  in a main menu that tells the player how to play, and get their name etc?

-plan a new route for teacher so it looks more natural?
